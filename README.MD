# Simple Demo
A quick sample front page built from a mockup, intended to highlight the
following features:
* Responsive, mobile-first design, including different navigation for mobile
  vs. desktop. 
* Works with or without JavaScript enabled.
* Uses CSS stylesheet for styling, including menu, links and responsive media queries.
* Basic consideration of accessibility via alt-text, fonts, spacing, layout,
  etc.
* Does not rely on any external frameworks such as Bootstrap.
* Uses vanilla JavaScript only (no jQuery required). 

Please excuse the low-resolution images, which were simply cut and pasted from the
mockup. As an initial foray into image editing, however, I did create the logo/favicon
based on the given design.
